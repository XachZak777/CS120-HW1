Welcome to HW assignment 1!

The first exercise is scanned in pdf format. 
You can also see the running of the third exercise in the same file as the Ex1.

The next exercises are in different .java files, every file has its main method, and the code is run in the main method.

The author of the code is me, there is no collaboration in the HW, 

There are the explanation and the logic of the code written as comments.


P.S.
I have changed my major from DS to CS, so this is the first java related assignment for me, please do not judge strictly.
